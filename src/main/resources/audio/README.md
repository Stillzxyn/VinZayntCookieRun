## Audio Format Requirements

### Supported Formats
- **MP3** (MPEG Layer 3) - Default, good compression
- **WAV** (Waveform Audio File) - Uncompressed, higher quality

### Audio Specifications

#### MP3 Format
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1 kHz recommended
- **Bitrate**: 128-256 kbps recommended for balance between quality and file size
- **Channels**: Mono or Stereo
- **Best for**: Background music, general sound effects

#### WAV Format
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1 kHz or higher
- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit or 24-bit
- **Channels**: Mono or Stereo
- **Best for**: High-quality sound effects, uncompressed audio

## Adding New Audio Files

1. Place audio files in the appropriate subdirectory (sfx/ or music/)
2. Ensure file names match the identifiers used in SoundManager.java
3. Use either MP3 or WAV format
4. If using WAV instead of MP3, update the file extensions in SoundManager.java:
   - Change `/audio/sfx/jump.mp3` to `/audio/sfx/jump.wav`
   - Change `/audio/music/stage1.mp3` to `/audio/music/stage1.wav`

## Integration

The SoundManager class automatically loads these assets during game initialization. The initializeSounds() method is called in CookieRunApp.start(), loading all audio files into memory for fast playback during gameplay.

### Example Audio Paths (in code):

#### Using MP3 Format
```java
// Sound effects
loadSoundEffect("jump", "/audio/sfx/jump.mp3");
loadSoundEffect("slide", "/audio/sfx/slide.mp3");

// Background music
loadBackgroundMusic("stage1", "/audio/music/stage1.mp3");
```

#### Using WAV Format
```java
// Sound effects
loadSoundEffect("jump", "/audio/sfx/jump.wav");
loadSoundEffect("slide", "/audio/sfx/slide.wav");

// Background music
loadBackgroundMusic("stage1", "/audio/music/stage1.wav");
```

## License

Audio files should be properly licensed or created for use in this game.
